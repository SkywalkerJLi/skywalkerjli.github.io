I am a junior at Princeton University studying Electical and Computer Engineering with minors in Applied Math, Statistics and Machine Learning, and Computer Science. I am a member of the [Intelligent Robot Motion Lab][irom-lab] led by [Anirudha Majumdar][anirudha-majumdar] and the [Fundamental and Applied Studies in Turbulence Group][fast-lab] led by [Marcus Hultmark][marcus-hultmark]. 

As an avid learner, I am always excited about solving challenging problems that impact society. Some of my interests are in reinforcement learning in robotics and currently I am researching novel task and motion planning algorithms with Professor [Tom Silver][tom-silver] in the new Princeton Robot Planning and Learning lab. My previous work was in developing a novel drone controller for gust-accepting flight. 

I am also interested in quantitative finance and its various challenges.
